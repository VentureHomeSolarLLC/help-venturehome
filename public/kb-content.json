The program has two components:\nUpfront incentive: A one-time payment based on the storage system&apos;s capacity (kWh). Standard residential systems can receive up to $16,000, paid through your installer within approximately 8 weeks of project approval. Low-income customers and those in underserved communities may qualify for higher incentive levels.\nPerformance incentive: Ongoing payments for up to 10 years based on how much energy your battery contributes to the grid during active dispatch events called by Eversource or UI — typically a few hours on high-demand summer and winter days. Payments are made twice per year.\nProgram change effective April 1, 2026: PURA approved a new performance-based framework for new enrollments. Passive dispatch (automatic summer pre-programming) has been phased out for new customers. New participants enroll under active dispatch with a smaller enrollment incentive and higher ongoing performance payments over 10 years.\nIf you are considering adding a battery to your Connecticut home, contact your Venture Home project manager to get the current incentive rates and available capacity — blocks are filled on a first-come, first-served basis.\nYour battery must be installed by a participating contractor registered with the CT Green Bank. Venture Home handles the ESS application on your behalf.\nLearn more: energystoragect.com\nProperty Tax Exemption\nConnecticut requires that all passive or active solar heating systems and geothermal energy resources be fully exempt from property taxes statewide (CGS § 12-81(57)). Your solar installation will not increase your property tax assessment. No application is required.\nSales Tax Exemption\nConnecticut exempts solar panel systems, battery storage, inverters, mounting equipment, and installation labor from the 6.35% state sales and use tax. The exemption is automatic at point of purchase — on a typical $20,000 system, this saves approximately $1,300.",

          "content": "Connecticut Utility Guide\nNet Metering Under the Residential Renewable Energy Solutions (RRES) Program\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering under the Netting Tariff\nA Solar Production Charge applies to all solar electricity generated — the rate depends on when your RRES application was submitted\nConnecticut Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) program offers meaningful battery incentives\nUtilities: Eversource Energy and United Illuminating (UI)\nNet Metering Policy\nConnecticut's current solar program, Residential Renewable Energy Solutions (RRES), offers two options: the Netting Tariff and Buy-All. Nearly all Venture Home customers are on the Netting Tariff.\nNetting Tariff\nThe Netting Tariff is 1-to-1 net metering: every kilowatt-hour (kWh) your solar system exports to the grid is credited against what you consume from the grid at the same retail rate. There is no annual true-up — excess credits roll forward month to month and year to year with no expiration.\nSolar Production Charge (Solar Energy Adjustment)\nThe key difference from older net metering programs is the Solar Production Charge, called the Solar Energy Adjustment on Eversource bills. This charge is based on your system's total solar production, measured by a production meter. The rate you pay depends on the year your RRES application was submitted to the utility — and it's locked in for 20 years.\nYear Application Submitted\nSolar Production Charge Rate\n2026\n$0.0402/kWh produced\n2025\n$0.005/kWh produced\n2024\nNo charge\n2022–2023 (Eversource)\n$0.03/kWh credit (not a charge)\nExample: A system producing 600 kWh in a month with a 2026 application date would be charged approximately $24 that month in Solar Production Charge — in addition to any remaining grid usage charges.\nMonthly Bill\nYour bill will typically include:\nFixed monthly charge ($9–$13)\nSolar Production Charge / Solar Energy Adjustment (based on total production)\nDelivery charges if you consumed more from the grid than you produced\nNet Supply Credit if you produced more than you consumed (offsets all charges including fixed and production charges, making a $0 bill possible)\nMany Connecticut solar customers generate excess credits from spring through fall, then draw them down in winter. This is expected and normal.\nEnergy Storage Incentives (ESS Program)\nThe Connecticut Energy Storage Solutions (ESS) Program, administered by the Connecticut Green Bank in partnership with Eversource and UI, offers two separate incentive tracks for battery customers.\nPassive Dispatch — Upfront Incentive\nCustomers receive an upfront discount for agreeing to 10 years of mandatory summer participation. The battery is automatically discharged on scheduled weekday events June–August, 5–8 PM. Current incentive rate: $212.50/kWh installed capacity (standard customers, as of late 2025).\nExample: 13.5 kWh Powerwall 3 = approximately $2,868 upfront\nParticipation is mandatory once enrolled — clawback penalties apply for underperformance\nActive Dispatch — Performance-Based Incentive\nCustomers are paid twice annually by the utility based on average kW performance during optional dispatch events (up to ~60 summer, ~5 winter events). No upfront discount.\nYear 1–5: $200/kW summer + $25/kW winter\nYear 6–10: $115/kW summer + $15/kW winter\nExample: 3 kW average performance = $675/year in years 1–5\nCustomers can enroll in both Passive and Active, Active only, or neither. Venture Home customers can discuss enrollment options with our team.\nProgram website: energystoragect.com\nMaine Utility Guide\n1-to-1 Net Energy Billing (Full-Service Customers)\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering (called Net Energy Billing in Maine)\nExcess credits roll forward for 12 months, then expire\nIf you receive supply from a Competitive Electric Provider (CEP) via a separate bill, your supply charges may not be credited — return to full utility service\nUtilities: Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Power\nNet Metering Policy\nMaine's program is officially called Net Energy Billing — Kilowatt-Hour Credit. Central Maine Power (CMP) and Versant Power are required under Maine Public Utilities Chapter 313 rules to offer 1-to-1 net metering to solar customers who receive full-service (both supply and distribution) from the utility.\nNet metering works by subtracting your solar production from your grid consumption in the same monthly billing cycle at the full retail rate. Each kWh you export offsets one kWh you consume. Any excess credits roll forward month to month for up to 12 months. Unused credits after 12 months expire — there is no cash payout.\nFixed Charges\nEven with a solar system sized to cover 100% of your usage, you will still receive a utility bill. Fixed customer charges ($24–$28/month) cover grid infrastructure costs and cannot be offset by solar credits. These are charged regardless of consumption.\nCompetitive Electric Providers — Important Warning\nMaine allows customers to choose their electricity supply from a Competitive Electric Provider (CEP) separate from CMP or Versant. If you receive two separate bills — one from your distribution utility and one from your CEP — your supply charges may not be credited under net metering.\nIf this applies to you, we strongly recommend switching back to full utility service (supply + distribution from CMP or Versant) to ensure you receive full 1-to-1 net metering benefits. Contact your utility to make this change.\nCMP Net Energy Billing: cmpco.com — search &quot;Net Energy Billing&quot;\nVersant Power: versantpower.com — search &quot;Net Energy Billing&quot;\nRECs and Additional Incentives\nMaine solar customers on customer-owned systems are eligible for Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs. Venture Home handles registration for all eligible customers. See the REC registration article for details on how this works and what action you need to take.\nMassachusetts Utility Guide\n1-to-1 Net Metering + Class 1 RECs\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering — excess credits roll forward indefinitely\nCustomer-owned systems (cash/loan/Participate Energy): enrolled in Net Metering + Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs\nState income tax credit: 15% of system cost up to $1,000 (Form Schedule SC)\nSales and property tax exemptions apply\nTPO customers (lease/PPA): enrolled in Net Metering only\nUtilities: Eversource, National Grid, Unitil\nNet Metering Policy\nAll three major Massachusetts investor-owned utilities — Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil — offer full 1-to-1 net metering for residential solar systems up to 25 kW AC (limit raised from 10 kW in February 2025).\nEach kWh your system exports to the grid is credited against future consumption at the full retail rate. Credits roll forward indefinitely — there is no expiration and no annual true-up cash-out. You simply draw them down when consumption exceeds production (evenings, winter months).\nYou will still receive a monthly utility bill to cover fixed customer charges ($10–$15/month) that cannot be offset by solar. These are normal and expected.\nWhat Venture Home Enrolls You In\nVenture Home enrolls Massachusetts customers in the programs appropriate for their system type:\nCustomer-owned systems (cash, loan, or Participate Energy financing): Net Metering + Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs. You receive retail-rate bill credits for your solar production and earn Class 1 RECs for every 1,000 kWh produced, which are sold on your behalf.\nTPO customers (lease or PPA, including SunStrong and Palmetto): Net Metering only. Your finance provider retains the REC rights as the system owner.\nNo action is required from you for either enrollment — Venture Home handles registration. If you receive an email from NEPOOL-GIS or the program registry asking you to verify your identity, complete it promptly. RECs accrue from your registration date, so delays mean lost credits.\nState Tax Credit\nMassachusetts offers a state income tax credit equal to 15% of qualified solar equipment costs, up to a maximum of $1,000. File Schedule SC with your state tax return. If you don't have sufficient tax liability in year one, the credit can carry forward up to 5 years. Consult a tax professional for guidance on your specific situation.\nTax Exemptions\nSales tax exemption: Solar equipment is fully exempt from Massachusetts 6.25% sales tax\nProperty tax exemption: Solar installations are exempt from property tax assessment for 20 years\nBattery Incentives — ConnectedSolutions\nMassachusetts battery customers served by Eversource, National Grid, or Unitil are eligible for ConnectedSolutions, a demand response program that pays you to reduce grid draw during peak summer periods. Enrollment is voluntary and does not meaningfully reduce your backup capability. Ask our team about current incentive rates and enrollment when you order a battery.\nNote on SREC programs: Massachusetts SREC-I and SREC-II are closed to new enrollment. Customer-owned systems are enrolled in Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs. TPO customers do not receive REC income — those rights belong to the system owner.\nNew Hampshire Utility Guide\nAlternative Net Metering (Monthly Netting with Reduced Rollover Rate)\nKey Takeaways\nMonthly netting at nearly full retail rate for production consumed in the same billing period\nExcess monthly production credited at a reduced rate (supply + transmission + 25% of distribution)\nNo annual true-up — credits roll forward indefinitely\nThird-party electric suppliers are not required to provide net metering credits\nUtilities: Eversource Energy NH, Unitil, Liberty Utilities\nAlternative Net Metering 2.0\nNew Hampshire's current program, in place since 2017, is the Alternative Net Metering Tariff. It works in two stages within each monthly billing cycle.\nMonthly Netting (Within the Same Billing Period)\nSolar production that offsets grid consumption in the same month nets nearly 1-to-1. You only pay a small non-bypassable charge of 1–2 cents per kWh on the portion offset — these support public benefit programs and cannot be avoided.\nExample: If you use 700 kWh from the grid and produce 700 kWh of solar, you pay only $7–$14 in non-bypassable charges plus your fixed customer charge ($14–$20/month).\nMonthly Excess Production (Rollover Credits)\nIf your solar production exceeds your consumption in a month, the surplus is credited at a reduced rate — the sum of the Default Energy Service (supply) charge, Transmission charge, and 25% of the Distribution charge. This is meaningfully less than the full retail rate.\nExample: If you produce 700 kWh but only use 500 kWh, the first 500 net at nearly retail. The excess 200 kWh rolls over at the reduced rate. These credits roll forward indefinitely with no expiration.\nIn practice, for a system sized to 100% of your annual usage, only about 10% of annual production is estimated to receive the lower rollover credit rate. The vast majority of production nets at the higher in-period rate.\nCompetitive Electric Suppliers — Important Warning\nNew Hampshire utilities are not required to provide net metering credits for customers who receive electricity supply from a Competitive Electric Supplier. If you switched your supply to a third-party provider, your solar credits may not apply to those supply charges.\nIf this applies to you, contact your utility to return to standard full-service electricity to ensure your system provides full net metering value.\nRECs\nNew Hampshire solar customers are eligible for Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs.

This credit directly reduces your Massachusetts state income tax liability.\nIf you cannot use the full credit in the year of installation, the unused portion can be carried forward to future tax years.\nOwner-only benefit: This credit applies to customer-owned systems (cash or loan purchases) only. TPO customers under a lease or PPA are not eligible.\nTo claim: File Schedule EC with your Massachusetts state income tax return (Form 1 or 1-NR/PY) for the year your system is placed in service.\nSchedule EC form and instructions: mass.gov — Schedule EC\nClass 1 NEPOOL-GIS Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)\nCustomer-owned systems in Massachusetts earn Class 1 RECs through NEPOOL-GIS (the regional grid&apos;s tracking system). Venture Home handles registration on your behalf. RECs are generated monthly based on your system&apos;s actual electricity production — 1 REC per 1 MWh produced.\nFor customers financing through Participate Energy (our managed credit program), RECs are sold on your behalf and the proceeds offset your system cost. For cash/loan customers, Venture Home enrolls your system and you retain the RECs or can elect to sell them.\nTPO note: If your system is financed through a SunStrong or Palmetto lease/PPA, the financing provider retains ownership of the RECs. Venture Home cannot enroll TPO systems for REC ownership.\nProperty Tax Exemption\nMassachusetts provides a 20-year property tax exemption for the value added to your home by a solar energy system. Even though solar panels can increase your property&apos;s market value, that additional value is fully excluded from your property tax assessment for 20 years after installation.\nThere is no separate application required in most municipalities — the exemption is applied automatically at assessment. Confirm with your local assessor&apos;s office. Statutory reference: M.G.L. ch. 59 § 5 (45, 45A).\nSales Tax Exemption\nAll solar energy equipment and installation labor in Massachusetts is exempt from the 6.25% state sales tax. This exemption is applied at the point of sale — no action is required on your part. On a $20,000 system, this represents approximately $1,250 in instant savings.",

Credits roll forward indefinitely — there is no expiration and no annual true-up cash-out. You simply draw them down when consumption exceeds production (evenings, winter months).\nYou will still receive a monthly utility bill to cover fixed customer charges ($10–$15/month) that cannot be offset by solar. These are normal and expected.\nWhat Venture Home Enrolls You In\nVenture Home enrolls Massachusetts customers in the programs appropriate for their system type:\nCustomer-owned systems (cash, loan, or Participate Energy financing): Net Metering + Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs. You receive retail-rate bill credits for your solar production and earn Class 1 RECs for every 1,000 kWh produced, which are sold on your behalf.\nTPO customers (lease or PPA, including SunStrong and Palmetto): Net Metering only. Your finance provider retains the REC rights as the system owner.\nNo action is required from you for either enrollment — Venture Home handles registration. If you receive an email from NEPOOL-GIS or the program registry asking you to verify your identity, complete it promptly. RECs accrue from your registration date, so delays mean lost credits.\nState Tax Credit\nMassachusetts offers a state income tax credit equal to 15% of qualified solar equipment costs, up to a maximum of $1,000. File Schedule SC with your state tax return. If you don't have sufficient tax liability in year one, the credit can carry forward up to 5 years. Consult a tax professional for guidance on your specific situation.\nTax Exemptions\nSales tax exemption: Solar equipment is fully exempt from Massachusetts 6.25% sales tax\nProperty tax exemption: Solar installations are exempt from property tax assessment for 20 years\nBattery Incentives — ConnectedSolutions\nMassachusetts battery customers served by Eversource, National Grid, or Unitil are eligible for ConnectedSolutions, a demand response program that pays you to reduce grid draw during peak summer periods. Enrollment is voluntary and does not meaningfully reduce your backup capability. Ask our team about current incentive rates and enrollment when you order a battery.\nNote on SREC programs: Massachusetts SREC-I and SREC-II are closed to new enrollment. Customer-owned systems are enrolled in Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs. TPO customers do not receive REC income — those rights belong to the system owner.",

The majority of NH cities and towns have adopted this exemption — it excludes the full assessed value of your solar equipment (panels, inverters, and for municipalities that re-adopted after January 1, 2020, battery storage too) from your property tax assessment.\nThe exemption amount and eligibility varies by municipality, but many offer a 100% exemption of equipment value.\nHow to apply: File Form PA-29 (Permanent Application for Property Tax Credits/Exemptions) with your local Assessor&apos;s Office by April 15 of the first year you want the exemption. You only need to file once — it renews automatically.\nForm PA-29: Available at your local town/city Assessor&apos;s Office or at \nrevenue.nh.gov — Form PA-29\nNote: To confirm your municipality has adopted the exemption and the specific amount offered, contact your local Assessor&apos;s Office. Not all NH towns participate, though the vast majority of major cities do (Concord, Nashua, Portsmouth, Dover, and others all offer it).\nNo State Sales or Income Tax\nNew Hampshire has no general sales tax, so you automatically save on the purchase of solar equipment without needing to take any action. There is also no state income tax in New Hampshire, so there is no state-level solar tax credit.",

It works in two stages within each monthly billing cycle.\nMonthly Netting (Within the Same Billing Period)\nSolar production that offsets grid consumption in the same month nets nearly 1-to-1. You only pay a small non-bypassable charge of 1–2 cents per kWh on the portion offset — these support public benefit programs and cannot be avoided.\nExample: If you use 700 kWh from the grid and produce 700 kWh of solar, you pay only $7–$14 in non-bypassable charges plus your fixed customer charge ($14–$20/month).\nMonthly Excess Production (Rollover Credits)\nIf your solar production exceeds your consumption in a month, the surplus is credited at a reduced rate — the sum of the Default Energy Service (supply) charge, Transmission charge, and 25% of the Distribution charge. This is meaningfully less than the full retail rate.\nExample: If you produce 700 kWh but only use 500 kWh, the first 500 net at nearly retail. The excess 200 kWh rolls over at the reduced rate. These credits roll forward indefinitely with no expiration.\nIn practice, for a system sized to 100% of your annual usage, only about 10% of annual production is estimated to receive the lower rollover credit rate. The vast majority of production nets at the higher in-period rate.\nCompetitive Electric Suppliers — Important Warning\nNew Hampshire utilities are not required to provide net metering credits for customers who receive electricity supply from a Competitive Electric Supplier. If you switched your supply to a third-party provider, your solar credits may not apply to those supply charges.\nIf this applies to you, contact your utility to return to standard full-service electricity to ensure your system provides full net metering value.\nRECs\nNew Hampshire solar customers are eligible for Class 1 NEPOOL-GIS RECs.

Under the SuSI program&apos;s Administratively Determined Incentive (ADI) track, residential solar owners earn SREC-II certificates that are redeemed for a fixed, guaranteed payment:\nResidential rate: $85 per SREC-II\n1 SREC-II = 1 MWh (1,000 kWh) of solar electricity generated\nPayments guaranteed for 15 years from your interconnection date\nA typical 7 kW system generating ~8 MWh/year earns approximately $680/year, or over $10,000 across the 15-year period\nSREC-IIs are separate from your net metering credits — you earn both. Venture Home registers your system with the New Jersey Clean Energy Program (NJCEP) and the PJM-EIS GATS tracking system on your behalf. Payments are made through InClime, the SREC-II administrator, once your system is certified.\nRate review: NJBPU periodically reviews SREC-II incentive levels. Residential systems that receive conditional approval before a rate change lock in the $85 rate for their full 15 years. Ask your project manager about timing.\nNJCEP SuSI Program: njcleanenergy.com/susi\nProperty Tax Exemption\nNew Jersey law exempts the added value of solar installations from local property taxes. Your solar system increases your home&apos;s market value, but that increase is fully excluded from your property tax assessment. With New Jersey&apos;s average effective property tax rate of approximately 2.3%, this saves the typical homeowner around $1,000 per year on property taxes.\nTo ensure the exemption is properly applied, contact your local property tax assessor after installation and confirm your solar system certification is on file.\nSales Tax Exemption\nNew Jersey provides a complete exemption from state sales tax for all solar energy equipment, including panels, inverters, mounting hardware, and battery storage. This is applied automatically at the point of sale — no application needed.",

Each kWh your solar system produces first powers your home; any excess exported to the grid earns a kWh credit that can be used in future months.\nAnniversary Month and Annual True-Up\nNet metering credits roll forward in a &quot;NEM bank&quot; indefinitely throughout the year — but once a year on your Anniversary Month, the bank is reset. Any credits remaining at that point are paid out at a low wholesale rate (typically 3–5 cents per kWh), not the full retail rate.\nYour Anniversary Month defaults to approximately 1–2 months after your system's Permission to Operate date. You may change it one time by contacting your utility.\nOur recommendation: February is typically the best Anniversary Month for New Jersey homeowners. It gives your system time to accumulate summer and fall credits and then draw them down through the winter before the account resets. A summer Anniversary Month would cause you to give back valuable credits at a fraction of their worth.\nNote: watch your bills for at least one full 12-month cycle before requesting a change. The utility only allows one change — make sure you've seen how your credits actually accumulate before deciding.\nPSE&amp;G guidance: &quot;The best month for your Anniversary True Up is the month before you begin to accumulate the most electricity credits.&quot;\nTime of Use Rates — Not Recommended\nNew Jersey's net metering program is not well-suited to Time of Use (TOU) rate plans. Under TOU, each time period (on-peak, off-peak) has a separate NEM bank, and credits earned in one period cannot offset charges in another. This typically results in large on-peak credit balances while paying full price for off-peak consumption. We recommend staying on a standard rate plan.\nTREC Program\nNew Jersey's Transition Renewable Energy Certificate (TREC) program pays customer-owned solar systems a fixed per-kWh incentive for electricity produced. TRECs are registered through the NJ Clean Energy Program.\nVenture Home handles TREC enrollment for all eligible customer-owned systems.

This charge is based on your solar system's nameplate DC capacity (in kW), not your production or consumption.\nUtility\n2026 CBC Rate (per kW DC per month)\nCon Edison\n$1.29/kW\nNational Grid\n$0.97/kW\nCentral Hudson\n$1.67/kW\nPSEG Long Island\n$1.13/kW\nNYSEG\n$1.19/kW\nRG&amp;E\n$1.31/kW\nOrange &amp; Rockland\n$1.00/kW\nExample: An 8 kW DC system served by National Grid would pay $7.76/month in CBC, in addition to the standard Basic Service Charge ($16–$24/month). This is partially or fully offset by your net metering credits in most months.\nNYS Solar &amp; Storage Tax Credit\nNew York residents who install solar on their primary residence may be eligible for the NYS Solar Tax Credit, worth 25% of qualified solar equipment costs up to a maximum of $5,000. This credit is available for purchased systems and for leased systems (credits are calculated based on annual lease payments).\nFile Form IT-255 with your New York State personal income tax return\nCredit can carry forward up to 5 years if you don't have sufficient tax liability in year one\nFor leased systems: you claim 100% of your annual lease payments each year until the $5,000 total cap is reached\nConsult a tax professional to confirm eligibility and how to apply based on your specific situation.

This is partially or fully offset by your net metering credits in most months.\nNYS Solar &amp; Storage Tax Credit\nNew York residents who install solar on their primary residence may be eligible for the NYS Solar Tax Credit, worth 25% of qualified solar equipment costs up to a maximum of $5,000. This credit is available for purchased systems and for leased systems (credits are calculated based on annual lease payments).\nFile Form IT-255 with your New York State personal income tax return\nCredit can carry forward up to 5 years if you don't have sufficient tax liability in year one\nFor leased systems: you claim 100% of your annual lease payments each year until the $5,000 total cap is reached\nConsult a tax professional to confirm eligibility and how to apply based on your specific situation. We cannot provide tax advice.\nBattery Incentives — Con Edison DLM Program\nCon Edison customers with battery storage can enroll in the Distributed Load Management (DLM) program, which pays for battery dispatch during peak grid demand. Contact our team or check Con Edison's website for current enrollment and incentive details.",

Your solar system earns one AEC per MWh of electricity produced, and those certificates can be sold to utilities and electricity suppliers who need them to meet Pennsylvania&apos;s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS).\nUnlike New Jersey&apos;s fixed SREC-II program, Pennsylvania AEC prices fluctuate with market supply and demand. Delaware homeowners can also access the PA SREC market.\nDelaware access: Delaware does not have its own SREC market but Delaware solar owners can register their systems to participate in the Pennsylvania AEC market. Venture Home can assist with registration for Delaware customers.\nVenture Home registers your PA system in the PJM-EIS GATS tracking system so your AECs are created and available for sale. You can sell through a broker or aggregator to utilities. Ask your project manager about current market pricing and your options for monetizing PA SRECs.\nProperty Tax\nPennsylvania does not have a formal statewide property tax exemption for solar. However, because PA property tax assessments are based on property values as of January 1 of the prior year, and reassessments are not triggered automatically, many homeowners find that their solar installation does not immediately or materially affect their property tax bill. This can vary by county — consult your local assessor or a tax professional for your specific situation.",

Each kWh your system produces first offsets home consumption; any excess exported earns a kWh credit at the full retail rate, applied to your next bill.\nCredits roll forward month to month throughout the year without expiration — until the annual cash-out.\nAnnual Cash-Out (May Billing Cycle)\nAfter the May billing cycle, Pennsylvania utilities are required by law to cash out any remaining NEM credits. You will receive either a check or a credit to your account for the balance — but at the &quot;Price to Compare&quot; rate, which is approximately half the retail rate (supply + transmission, excluding distribution).\nThis means credits that roll from summer into winter are fully valuable, but any leftover balance after May is paid out at a significantly reduced rate. Plan accordingly — the ideal scenario is consuming most of your accumulated credits before the May reset.\nCompetitive Electric Suppliers — Important Warning\nPennsylvania utilities are not required to provide net metering credits if you receive electricity supply from a third-party Competitive Electric Supplier. If you switched your supply service and receive a separate supply bill, your solar credits may not apply to those supply and transmission charges.\nIf this applies to you, contact your distribution utility to return to full-service electricity to maximize your net metering value.\nSRECs\nPennsylvania solar customers are eligible to earn and sell Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) via the PJM-GATS registry.

Credits are tracked in kWh, not dollars.\nEach kWh your system produces that exceeds home consumption is credited to your account. You draw credits back down when production is insufficient (nights, winter). Fixed monthly charges (meter fees) must be paid in cash and cannot be offset by kWh credits.\nAnnual True-Up\nNet metering credits reset at the end of your chosen 12-month period. Unlike some states, Delaware does not pay out unused credits — any remaining kWh credits simply expire. You can choose your annual true-up month one time; you may change it once after that.\nOur recommendation: Choose March or April as your true-up month. This timing lets you accumulate summer and fall solar credits and draw them down through winter, maximizing the kWh you consume before the reset.\nGreen Energy Program (Upfront Rebates)\nDelaware's Green Energy Program provides upfront rebates through participating utilities:\nDelmarva Power: ~$0.70/watt, up to $6,000 — application handled by Venture Home as part of installation\nDelaware Electric Cooperative: $0.50/watt for first 5 kW, $0.20/watt thereafter\nNote: Green Energy Program rebates are applied directly to your installation cost\nSREC Program\nDelaware's SREC Delaware program allows customer-owned solar systems to earn and sell Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) via an annual auction process. One SREC is generated for every 1,000 kWh (1 MWh) your system produces.\nYears 1–10: ~$30/SREC (price determined at auction — recent prices have held steady)\nYears 11–25: $10/SREC flat rate\nSubmit monthly production meter readings through the SREC Delaware online portal (Venture Home provides setup guidance)\nPayments are on a 2-month delay from production\nExample: An 8 kW system generating ~10 SRECs/year earns roughly $300/year in years 1–10.\nNote: Delaware is actively studying potential net metering policy changes (Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, January 2025). We will keep customers informed if significant changes are made.\nMaryland Utility Guide\n1-to-1 Net Metering with Annual Cash-Out + Active SREC Market\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering — credits roll forward month to month\nAnnual cash-out in April: any remaining credits paid at average annual commodity rate (~$0.04–$0.07/kWh) or carried forward indefinitely (your choice as of 2025)\nActive SREC market via PJM-GATS — Venture Home handles registration\nProperty and sales tax exemptions\nUtilities: BGE, Pepco, Potomac Edison, Delmarva Power MD, SMECO, Choptank Electric\nNet Metering Policy\nMaryland requires all major utilities to provide 1-to-1 net metering. Each kWh your system produces first offsets home consumption; any excess earns a kWh credit at the full retail rate. Credits roll forward month to month.\nAnnual Cash-Out (April)\nEach April, Maryland utilities reconcile net metering accounts. As of 2025, you have two options for any remaining credits:\nCash out: receive payment at the average annual commodity rate, typically $0.04–$0.07/kWh (significantly below retail)\nCarry forward indefinitely: keep credits rolling on your account with no expiration\nFor most customers, carrying credits forward is the better financial choice. Only consider requesting cash-out if you're moving or have an unusual situation.\nSRECs\nMaryland has an active SREC market through PJM-GATS. Customer-owned solar systems earn one SREC per 1,000 kWh (1 MWh) of production. SRECs can be sold to utilities and electricity suppliers who must meet Maryland's Renewable Portfolio Standard.\nSREC prices in Maryland fluctuate based on market supply and demand. Venture Home handles PJM-GATS registration for all eligible customer-owned systems. Once registered, SRECs are typically sold through an aggregator or broker.\nTax Exemptions\nProperty tax: Solar systems are exempt from property tax assessment statewide\nSales tax: Solar equipment is fully exempt from Maryland's 6% sales tax\nWashington D.C. Utility Guide\n1-to-1 Net Metering + Among the Highest SREC Values in the Country\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering — credits roll forward month to month\nYear-end: credits expire December 31, but Pepco pays out remaining balance (at generation-only rate, ~8–9¢/kWh) if over $25\nDC SRECs are among the most valuable in the US — prices fluctuate but have recently traded around $400/SREC\nNo DC-specific battery incentives currently\nUtility: Pepco (sole electric utility in DC)\nNet Metering Policy\nPepco provides 1-to-1 net metering throughout DC. Each kWh your system exports earns a kWh credit at the full retail rate. Credits roll forward month to month through December 31.\nAt year-end, credits expire — but Pepco pays out any remaining balance greater than $25 at the generation-only rate (approximately $0.088/kWh as of early 2025, which excludes transmission costs). This is lower than retail but ensures you're not simply losing credits.\nYou will still receive a monthly fixed charge (~$18) that cannot be offset by solar credits.\nDC SRECs — Exceptional Value\nDC has one of the strongest SREC markets in the country, driven by DC's ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard (100% renewable energy by 2032 with aggressive solar carve-outs) and high Alternative Compliance Payments that utilities pay if they fall short.\n1 SREC is generated per 1,000 kWh (1 MWh) of solar production\nDC SREC prices fluctuate based on market conditions — recent prices have hovered around $400/SREC, though this can vary\nA typical 8 kW system generating ~10 MWh/year earns ~$4,000/year in SREC income\nSRECs are valid for 3 years from date of generation\nBy contrast, Maryland SRECs trade at roughly $50–$60. If you're a Maryland customer served by Pepco and your home is on DC feeder lines (common in border areas of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties), you may be eligible for DC's SREC market — contact us to confirm.\nVenture Home registers all eligible DC customer-owned systems in the DC SREC market. Once registered, SRECs are typically sold through a broker who pays you directly.\nState Tax Incentives\nDC does not currently offer a state-level solar tax credit or battery-specific incentive. The primary financial drivers in DC are net metering and the SREC program, which together provide exceptional economics for solar customers.",

Solar owners earn one SREC for every MWh their system produces over the first 15 years, and can sell those SRECs to utilities on the Maryland SREC market.\nCurrent Maryland SREC market prices are approximately $50–55 per SREC (the Solar Alternative Compliance Payment, or SACP, is set at $55 for 2025 and declines gradually to $22.50 by 2030). An average 8 kW system producing 9 MWh/year can earn approximately $450–500 annually in SREC income, totaling an estimated $3,500–4,000 over 15 years.\nVenture Home registers your system in PJM-EIS GATS so your SRECs are created and available for sale. You can engage a broker to sell your SRECs — Venture Home can point you to reputable options.\nProperty Tax Exemption\nMaryland provides a 100% state and local real property tax exemption for solar energy systems used to heat or cool a structure, provide hot water, or generate electricity. This applies to both residential and commercial properties. Your solar installation will not increase your property tax assessment — no action required.\nIn addition, certain counties offer supplemental local property tax credits (these are one-time credits, separate from the statewide exemption):\nAnne Arundel County: Up to $2,500 one-time property tax credit\nHarford County: Up to $2,500 per solar device, $5,000 per property per fiscal year\nPrince George&apos;s County: Up to $5,000 alternative energy tax credit (also available to lessees)\nContact your county tax authority or your Venture Home project manager for current program details and application requirements.\nSales Tax Exemption\nMaryland exempts solar energy equipment (panels, inverters, mounting, battery storage) and solar water heaters from state sales and use tax. The exemption is automatic at point of purchase — on a $20,000 system, this saves approximately $1,200 (6% rate).",

Each kWh your system produces first offsets home consumption; any excess earns a kWh credit at the full retail rate. Credits roll forward month to month.\nAnnual Cash-Out (April)\nEach April, Maryland utilities reconcile net metering accounts. As of 2025, you have two options for any remaining credits:\nCash out: receive payment at the average annual commodity rate, typically $0.04–$0.07/kWh (significantly below retail)\nCarry forward indefinitely: keep credits rolling on your account with no expiration\nFor most customers, carrying credits forward is the better financial choice. Only consider requesting cash-out if you're moving or have an unusual situation.\nSRECs\nMaryland has an active SREC market through PJM-GATS. Customer-owned solar systems earn one SREC per 1,000 kWh (1 MWh) of production. SRECs can be sold to utilities and electricity suppliers who must meet Maryland's Renewable Portfolio Standard.\nSREC prices in Maryland fluctuate based on market supply and demand. Venture Home handles PJM-GATS registration for all eligible customer-owned systems. Once registered, SRECs are typically sold through an aggregator or broker.\nTax Exemptions\nProperty tax: Solar systems are exempt from property tax assessment statewide\nSales tax: Solar equipment is fully exempt from Maryland's 6% sales tax\nWashington D.C. Utility Guide\n1-to-1 Net Metering + Among the Highest SREC Values in the Country\nKey Takeaways\n1-to-1 net metering — credits roll forward month to month\nYear-end: credits expire December 31, but Pepco pays out remaining balance (at generation-only rate, ~8–9¢/kWh) if over $25\nDC SRECs are among the most valuable in the US — prices fluctuate but have recently traded around $400/SREC\nNo DC-specific battery incentives currently\nUtility: Pepco (sole electric utility in DC)\nNet Metering Policy\nPepco provides 1-to-1 net metering throughout DC. Each kWh your system exports earns a kWh credit at the full retail rate. Credits roll forward month to month through December 31.\nAt year-end, credits expire — but Pepco pays out any remaining balance greater than $25 at the generation-only rate (approximately $0.088/kWh as of early 2025, which excludes transmission costs). This is lower than retail but ensures you're not simply losing credits.\nYou will still receive a monthly fixed charge (~$18) that cannot be offset by solar credits.\nDC SRECs — Exceptional Value\nDC has one of the strongest SREC markets in the country, driven by DC's ambitious Renewable Portfolio Standard (100% renewable energy by 2032 with aggressive solar carve-outs) and high Alternative Compliance Payments that utilities pay if they fall short.\n1 SREC is generated per 1,000 kWh (1 MWh) of solar production\nDC SREC prices fluctuate based on market conditions — recent prices have hovered around $400/SREC, though this can vary\nA typical 8 kW system generating ~10 MWh/year earns ~$4,000/year in SREC income\nSRECs are valid for 3 years from date of generation\nBy contrast, Maryland SRECs trade at roughly $50–$60. If you're a Maryland customer served by Pepco and your home is on DC feeder lines (common in border areas of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties), you may be eligible for DC's SREC market — contact us to confirm.\nVenture Home registers all eligible DC customer-owned systems in the DC SREC market. Once registered, SRECs are typically sold through a broker who pays you directly.\nState Tax Incentives\nDC does not currently offer a state-level solar tax credit or battery-specific incentive. The primary financial drivers in DC are net metering and the SREC program, which together provide exceptional economics for solar customers.",
